# PeachtreeData.com

Note: If you would like to log into the site and see an account that already has seed-data in it, the backend is still deployed through Heroku, thus you can run the application locally and login using username "ekim1707@gmail.com" and password "yes" (it will probably take a second before it responds due to Heroku free plan). Otherwise, if you can make your own account, but it will look very empty, other than the media page.
